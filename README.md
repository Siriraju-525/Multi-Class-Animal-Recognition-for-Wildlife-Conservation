# Multi-Class-Animal-Recognition-for-Wildlife-Conservation
Multi-Class Animal Classification is a deep learning project that classifies animal images into categories using a CNN model. It follows four steps: Collect, Preprocess, Train, and Evaluate. The model learns visual features from images to accurately predict animal classes for real-world applications.
